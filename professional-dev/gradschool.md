So you want to apply to graduate school in engineering? Where to start? This guide is targeted towards undergraduate civil engineering students though it may be useful for other disciplines. 

# Determine Why You Want to Go
Why do you want to go graduate school? Graduate school might be a good fit if:
- You want to dive deeper into a specific subdiscipline
- You want to change your field of study or attend a professional school (e.g., Law school, though my resources mostly pertain to engineering schools)
- You want to make connections for a future job 
- Your current job, or the career/job you want requires or requests a graduate degree (for example, many structural engineering firms prefer candidates with master's degrees)

# Masters or PhD?
What kind of program are you interested in? 

## Coursework-based master's programs
Coursework-based master's programs are probably most similar to your undergraduate degree program. In these programs, expect to take classes within your discipline or subdiscipline and then graduate with your degree! These programs are typically 1-2 years, and there is often limited funding. The programs will generally set you up well for a career in industry, and you can expect to make good connections wherever the program is based.

## Research-based master's programs
Research-based master's programs a combination of coursework and research. You will work with a professor to complete a research project (i.e., a master's thesis). The programs are typically 2 years. One advantage to a research-based master's program is that you can often get funding for tuition and a very modest stipend. These types of programs may be good for someone who is interested in research, who wants a funded position, and potentially may be interested in a Ph.D. If you want to apply to these types of programs, I highly recommend you contact faculty who you are interested in doing research with _in advance_ of applying.

## Ph.D. programs
Do you want to be an industry expert or professor? Do you love research? A Ph.D. program might be right for you. Ph.D. programs are typically fully funded (tuition and stipend) and last 4-6 years. You will take some classes but primarily work on an independent research project (i.e., your dissertation).

# Search for Schools
A school’s reputation is an important factor, but it’s often overrated, especially for graduate school. The most important criteria involve how well the program matches your specific interests, abilities, academic background and finances. 

# Prepare Materials
## GRE
Many graduate schools require you take the GRE. More information on the GRE is coming soon. 
## Statement of Purpose
Your statement of purpose tells the graduate school why and how you are a good fit. Like your resume, make sure to get as much feedback on your statement of purpose as possible. Resources on writing a statement of purpose coming soon!
## Recommendation Letters
You will need recommendation letters from supervisors and/or professors. Be sure to reach out well in advance of the deadline. Resources on how to ask for and get good recommendation letters is coming soon. 
# Reach out to Faculty
Interested in a research-based graduate program (M.S. or Ph.D.)? It is important you reach out to faculty who you would enjoy doing research with in advance. [Here](https://contemplativemammoth.com/2013/04/08/so-you-want-to-go-to-grad-school-nail-the-inquiry-email/) is more information on contacting faculty. [Here](https://futurerockdoc.com/blog/2021/11/20/questions-you-should-ask-a-potential-graduate-school-adviser) are some questions to ask a potential faculty advisor.
# Apply 
I recommend you apply to no more than 5 schools (and even that is a lot!). 
# Go
Don't forget to enjoy the journey!
